Description: eye is dedicated to facilitate ophthalmic research. 
  Its core functions va(), eyes(), myop(), blink(), reveal() and 
  age() are designed to help with common tasks in eye research: 
  Visual acuity conversion for snellen, logMAR and ETDRS, counting patients and 
  eyes, summarising data with common statistics, calculating age of patients, 
  and reshaping eye-specific data from wide to long. 
  eye also contains a real life data set of people who received intravitreal 
  injections due to age-related macular degeneration in 
  Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK.
