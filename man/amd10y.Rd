\section{Study setting and design}{

Retrospective cohort study of treatment-na√Øve, first-affected eyes with
nAMD started on ranibizumab before January 1, 2009.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
}

\section{Data source}{

All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates
are performed overnight to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
VA is reported in ETDRS letter score (and categories for ETDRS < 1).
The highest value (independent of measurement method)
available at each visit was chosen.
