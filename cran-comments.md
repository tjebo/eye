## Submission version 0.1.1
This is a first patch for version 0.1
In this version I have:

* Added URLs to the description file, including bug report field
* Updated the inbuilt data set `amd`, because it was in the meanwhile updated by the data set curator (replaced erroneous entries with missing values). 
* Update information in eye.Rd and in the vignette: Replaced the paragraph about erroneous entries with a paragraph about missing values in the `amd` data set. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* ubuntu Ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release), R 4.0.0
* R-hub

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
