The visual acuity (VA) of patients with very low vision is classified using the semiquantitative scale “counting fingers” (CF), “hand motion” (HM), “light perception” (LP), and “no light perception.” More quantitative measures would be desirable, especially for clinical studies. The results of clinical VA measurements, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts, and the Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT) were compared. The FrACT is a computerized visual acuity test that can present very large Landolt C optotypes when necessary.  methods. Examined were 100 eyes of 100 patients with various eye diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, ARMD), covering a range of VAs from LP to decimal 0.32. The FrACT optotypes were presented on a 17-inch LCD monitor with random orientation. After extensive training, two ETDRS and FrACT measurements were obtained. The testing distance was 50 or 100 cm.  results. ETDRS and FrACT coincided closely for VA ≥ 0.02 (n = 80). ETDRS measures were successfully obtainable down to CF (at 30 cm; test–retest averaged over all patients, coefficient of variation [CV]ETDRS= 9\\% ± 8\\%), and FrACT provided reproducible measurements down to HM (test–retest CVFrACT=12\\% ± 11\\%). For CF (n = 6), both ETDRS and FrACT resulted in a mean VA of 0.014 ± 0.003 (range, 0.01–0.02). The VA results of FrACT for HM (n = 12) were 0.005 ± 0.002 (range, 0.003–0.009); the individual values were highly reproducible. No results were obtainable for LP (n = 2).  conclusions. The three acuity procedures concur above a VA of 0.02. The results suggest that the category CF at 30 cm can be replaced by 0.014, using ETDRS or FrACT. Using FrACT, one can even reproducibly quantify VA in the HM-range, yielding a mean VA of 0.005. }",

	abstract = {Objectives To analyse treatment outcomes and share clinical data from a large, single-centre, well-curated database (8174 eyes/6664 patients with 120 756 single entries) of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By making our depersonalised raw data openly available, we aim to stimulate further research in AMD, as well as set a precedent for future work in this area.Setting Retrospective, comparative, non-randomised electronic medical record (EMR) database cohort study of the UK Moorfields AMD database with data extracted between 2008 and 2018.Participants Including one eye per patient, 3357 eyes/patients (61\% female). Extraction criteria were >=1 ranibizumab or aflibercept injection, entry of {\textquoteleft}AMD{\textquoteright} in the diagnosis field of the EMR and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Exclusion criteria were unknown date of first injection and treatment outside of routine clinical care at Moorfields before the first recorded injection in the database.Main outcome measures Primary outcome measure was change in VA at 1 and 2 years from baseline as measured in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Secondary outcomes were the number of injections and predictive factors for VA gain.Results Mean VA gain at 1 year and 2 years were +5.5 (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.0) and +4.9 (95\% CI 4.2 to 5.6) letters, respectively. Fifty-four per cent of eyes gained >=5 letters at 2 years, 63\% had stable VA ({\textpm}<=14 letters), 44\% of eyes maintained good VA (>=70 letters). Patients received a mean of 7.7 (95\% CI 7.6 to 7.8) injections during year 1 and 13.0 (95\% CI 12.8 to 13.2) injections over 2 years. Younger age, lower baseline VA and more injections were associated with higher VA gain at 2 years.Conclusion This study benchmarks high quality EMR study results of real life AMD treatment and promotes open science in clinical AMD research by making the underlying data publicly available.},
