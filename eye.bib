    abstract = "{  purpose. The visual acuity (VA) of patients with very low vision is classified using the semiquantitative scale “counting fingers” (CF), “hand motion” (HM), “light perception” (LP), and “no light perception.” More quantitative measures would be desirable, especially for clinical studies. The results of clinical VA measurements, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts, and the Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT) were compared. The FrACT is a computerized visual acuity test that can present very large Landolt C optotypes when necessary.  methods. Examined were 100 eyes of 100 patients with various eye diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, ARMD), covering a range of VAs from LP to decimal 0.32. The FrACT optotypes were presented on a 17-inch LCD monitor with random orientation. After extensive training, two ETDRS and FrACT measurements were obtained. The testing distance was 50 or 100 cm.  results. ETDRS and FrACT coincided closely for VA ≥ 0.02 (n = 80). ETDRS measures were successfully obtainable down to CF (at 30 cm; test–retest averaged over all patients, coefficient of variation [CV]ETDRS= 9\\% ± 8\\%), and FrACT provided reproducible measurements down to HM (test–retest CVFrACT=12\\% ± 11\\%). For CF (n = 6), both ETDRS and FrACT resulted in a mean VA of 0.014 ± 0.003 (range, 0.01–0.02). The VA results of FrACT for HM (n = 12) were 0.005 ± 0.002 (range, 0.003–0.009); the individual values were highly reproducible. No results were obtainable for LP (n = 2).  conclusions. The three acuity procedures concur above a VA of 0.02. The results suggest that the category CF at 30 cm can be replaced by 0.014, using ETDRS or FrACT. Using FrACT, one can even reproducibly quantify VA in the HM-range, yielding a mean VA of 0.005. }",

By making our depersonalised raw data openly available, we aim to stimulate further research in AMD, as well as set a precedent for future work in this area.Setting Retrospective, comparative, non-randomised electronic medical record (EMR) database cohort study of the UK Moorfields AMD database with data extracted between 2008 and 2018.Participants Including one eye per patient, 3357 eyes/patients (61\% female). Extraction criteria were >=1 ranibizumab or aflibercept injection, entry of {\textquoteleft}AMD{\textquoteright} in the diagnosis field of the EMR and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Exclusion criteria were unknown date of first injection and treatment outside of routine clinical care at Moorfields before the first recorded injection in the database.Main outcome measures Primary outcome measure was change in VA at 1 and 2 years from baseline as measured in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Secondary outcomes were the number of injections and predictive factors for VA gain.Results Mean VA gain at 1 year and 2 years were +5.5 (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.0) and +4.9 (95\% CI 4.2 to 5.6) letters, respectively. Fifty-four per cent of eyes gained >=5 letters at 2 years, 63\% had stable VA ({\textpm}<=14 letters), 44\% of eyes maintained good VA (>=70 letters). Patients received a mean of 7.7 (95\% CI 7.6 to 7.8) injections during year 1 and 13.0 (95\% CI 12.8 to 13.2) injections over 2 years. Younger age, lower baseline VA and more injections were associated with higher VA gain at 2 years.Conclusion This study benchmarks high quality EMR study results of real life AMD treatment and promotes open science in clinical AMD research by making the underlying data publicly available.},

The primary outcome was time to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) falling <=35 ETDRS letters after initiating anti-VEGF therapy. Secondary outcomes included time to BCVA reaching >=70 letters, proportion of eyes with BCVA >=70 and <=35 letters in 10~years, mean trend of BCVA and central retinal thickness over 10~years, and mean number of injections.Results For our cohort of 103 patients, Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated median time to BCVA reaching <=35 and >=70 letters were 37.8 (95\% CI 22.2 to 65.1) and 8.3 (95\% CI 4.8 to 20.9) months after commencing anti-VEGF therapy, respectively. At the final follow-up, BCVA was <=35 letters and >=70 letters in 41.1\% and 21\%, respectively, in first-affected eyes, while this was the case for 5.4\% and 48.2\%, respectively, in a patient{\textquoteright}s better-seeing eye. Mean injection number was 37.0{\textpm}24.2 per eye and 53.6{\textpm}30.1 at patient level (63.1\% of patients required injections in both eyes).Conclusions The chronicity of nAMD disease and its management highlights the importance of long-term visual prognosis. Our analyses suggest that one in five patients will retain good vision (BCVA >=70 ETDRS letters) in the first-affected eye at 10~years after starting anti-VEGF treatment; yet, one in two patients will have good vision in their better-seeing eye. Moreover, our data suggest that early treatment of nAMD is associated with better visual outcomes.},

abstract = "Purpose
To apply a deep learning algorithm for automated, objective, and comprehensive quantification of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to a large real-world dataset of eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and make the raw segmentation output data openly available for further research.
Design
Retrospective analysis of OCT images from the Moorfields Eye Hospital AMD Database.
Participants
2473 first-treated eyes and another 493 second-treated eyes that commenced therapy for neovascular AMD between June 2012 and June 2017.
Methods
A deep learning algorithm was used to segment all baseline OCT scans. Volumes were calculated for segmented features such as neurosensory retina (NSR), drusen, intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), hyperreflective foci (HRF), fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment (fvPED), and serous PED (sPED). Analyses included comparisons between first and second eyes, by visual acuity (VA) and by race/ethnicity, and correlations between volumes.
Main outcome measures
Volumes of segmented features (mm3), central subfield thickness (CST) (μm).
Results
In first-treated eyes, the majority had both IRF and SRF (54.7%). First-treated eyes had greater volumes for all segmented tissues, with the exception of drusen, which was greater in second-treated eyes. In first-treated eyes, older age was associated with lower volumes for RPE, SRF, NSR and sPED; in second-treated eyes, older age was associated with lower volumes of NSR, RPE, sPED, fvPED and SRF. Eyes from black individuals had higher SRF, RPE and serous PED volumes, compared with other ethnic groups. Greater volumes of the vast majority of features were associated with worse VA.
Conclusion
We report the results of large scale automated quantification of a novel range of baseline features in neovascular AMD. Major differences between first and second-treated eyes, with increasing age, and between ethnicities are highlighted. In the coming years, enhanced, automated OCT segmentation may assist personalization of real-world care, and the detection of novel structure-function correlations. These data will be made publicly available for replication and future investigation by the AMD research community."

    abstract = "{Although multiple imputation models for missing data and the use of mixed-effects models generally provide better outcome estimates than using only observed data or last observation carried forward in clinical trials, such approaches usually cannot be applied to visual outcomes from retrospective analyses of clinical practice settings, also called real-world outcomes.To explore the potential usefulness of survival analysis techniques for retrospective clinical practice visual outcomes.This retrospective cohort study covered a 12-year observation period at a tertiary eye center. Of 10 744 eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration receiving anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy between October 28, 2008, and February 1, 2020, 7802 eyes met study criteria (treatment-naive, first-treated eyes starting anti-VEGF therapy). Eyes were excluded from the analysis if they received photodynamic therapy or macular laser, any previous anti-VEGF therapy, treatment with anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab or aflibercept, or had an unknown date or visual acuity (VA) value at first injection.Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to consider VA reaching an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score of 70 (Snellen equivalent, 20/40) or better, duration of VA sustained at or better than 70 (20/40), and VA declining to 35 (20/200) or worse.A total of 7802 patients (mean [SD] age, 78.7 [8.8] years; 4776 women [61.2\\%]; and 4785 White [61.3\\%]) were included in the study. The median time to attaining a VA letter score greater than or equal to 70 (20/40) was 2.0 years (95\\% CI, 1.87-2.32) after the first anti-VEGF injection. Predictive features were baseline VA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43 per 5 ETDRS letter score or 1 line; 95\\% CI, 1.40-1.46), baseline age (HR, 0.88 per 5 years; 95\\% CI, 0.86-0.90), and injection number (HR, 1.12; 95\\% CI, 1.10-1.15). Of the 4439 of 7802 patients (57\\%) attaining this outcome, median time sustained at an ETDRS letter score of 70 (20/40) or better was 1.1 years (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.2).In this cohort study, patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration beginning anti-VEGF therapy were more likely to experience positive visual outcomes within the first 2.0 years after treatment, typically maintaining this outcome for 1.1 years but then deteriorating to poor vision within 8.7 years. These findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of the proposed analyses. This data set, combined with the statistical approach for retrospective analyses, may provide long-term prognostic information for patients newly diagnosed with this condition.}",
