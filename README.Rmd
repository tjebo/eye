## Purpose
*eye* is dedicated to facilitate ophthalmic research. Its functions [`va()`](#va), [`eyes()`](#eyes), [`myop()`](#myop), [`blink()`](#blink), [`reveal()`](#reveal) and [`age()`](#age) are designed to help with common tasks in eye research:
  
- Visual acuity conversion for snellen, logMAR and ETDRS
- Counting patients and eyes
- Reshape data from wide to long:  
  Often, one variables spreads over two columns for right and left eyes. But many functions need the data "long", with only one 
column for each variable and a separate column for eyes 
- Summarising data with common statistics (mean, sd, n, range)
- Calculating age of patients
  
*eye* includes [`amd`](#amd-data), a real life data set of people who received intravitreal injections due to age-related macular degeneration. [@fasler]
    
Finally, *eye* also comes with the ggplot2 extension [`geom_trail()`](#geom_trail) for some nice trail graphs.

## Details and examples
### va
Easy conversion from visual acuity notations in a single call to `va()`: Automatic detection of VA notation and convert to logMAR by default (but you can convert to snellen or ETDRS as well).

- VA conversion between Snellen, ETDRS and logMAR is based on charts and formulas in [@holladay], [@beck] and [@gregori]
- Categories **counting fingers** and **hand movements** are converted following [@bach]
- Categories **(no) light perception** are converted following the suggestions by Michael Bach
- Visual acuity conversion chart [`va_chart`](#va-conversion-chart)                             
```{r va}
## automatic detection of VA notation and converting to logMAR by default
x <- c(23, 56, 74, 58) ## ETDRS letters
va(x)

va(x, to = "snellen") ## ... or convert to snellen

x <- c("NPL", "LP", "HM", "CF","20/200", "6/9", "20/40+3", "20/50-2") 
## snellen with "plus/minus" entries, mixed with categories 
va(x)

## on the inbuilt data set:
head(va(amd$VA_ETDRS_Letters), 10) 

## and indeed, there are unplausible ETDRS values in this data set:
range(amd$VA_ETDRS_Letters)
```
                            
### eyes
Count patient and eyes (**eyes** or **eyestr**)
```{r eyes}
eyes(amd)
```

#### eyestr
Same as `eyes`, but as text for reports
```{r eyestr}
eyestr(amd)
 
 ## Numbers smaller than or equal to 12 will be real English
eyestr(head(amd, 100))
```

### myop
Make your data long ("myopic")
```{r myop, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(42)
iop_wide <- data.frame(id = letters[1:3], iop_r = sample(11:13), iop_l = sample(14:16))
```
```{r myop2}
## Simple data frame with one column for right eye and left eye.
iop_wide

myop(iop_wide)
```

Often enough, there are right eye / left eye columns for more than one variable, e.g., for both IOP and VA. `myop` helps you clean this mess and will detect those variable columns automatically.

This is an example of such a messy data frame:
<details>
<summary>Click to unfold code to create messy df </summary>
```{r messy df}
messy_df <- data.frame(
  id = letters[1:4], 
  surgery_right = c("TE", "TE", "SLT", "SLT"),
  surgery_left = c("TE", "TE", "TE", "SLT"),
  iop_r_preop = 21:24, iop_r_postop = 11:14,
  iop_l_preop = 31:34, iop_l_postop = 11:14, 
  va_r_preop = 41:44, va_r_postop = 45:48,
  va_l_preop = 41:44, va_l_postop = 45:48
)
```
</details>
```{r eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# library(flextable)
# messy_df %>%
#   flextable() %>% 
#   autofit() %>%
#   save_as_image("messy.png", zoom = 3, expand = 10, webshot = "webshot")
```

<img src="man/figures/messy.png"/>
```{r myop two vars}
clean_df <- myop(messy_df)

clean_df
```

### blink 
See your data in a blink of an eye - wrapper around [`myop`](#myop), [`eyes`](#eyes), [`va`](#va) and [`reveal`](#reveal). It will look for VA and for IOP columns and provide the summary stats for the entire cohort and for right and left eyes for each variable. 
```{r}
blink(messy_df)
```

### reveal
Show common statistics for all numeric columns, for the entire cohort or aggregated by group(s):
```{r stats, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
reveal(clean_df)

reveal(clean_df, by = "eye")

reveal(clean_df, by = c("eye", "surgery"))
```

### age
- Calculate age in years, as [periods or durations](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/articles/lubridate.html#time-intervals)
                                                                     
```{r age, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dob <- c("1984-10-16", "2000-01-01")

## If no second date given, the age today
age(dob)
age(dob, "2000-01-01")                                                    
```

### geom_trail
A base plot type = "b" equivalent for ggplot. Works also with text!

<details>

<summary>Prepare AMD data for plot (click to unfold) </summary>

```{r trail, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
amd_aggr <-
  amd %>%
  group_by(
    age_cut10 = cut_width(BaselineAge, 10),
    days_cut90 = cut_width(FollowupDays, 90, labels = seq(0, 810, 90))
  ) %>%
  summarise(mean_va = mean(VA_ETDRS_Letters)) %>%
  filter(as.integer(days_cut90) <= 9)
```
</details>

```{r geom_trail}
p <-
  ggplot(amd_aggr, aes(days_cut90, mean_va, color = age_cut10)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Follow up time [binned by 90 days]", y = "Mean VA [ETDRS letters]",
    color = "Age strata"
  )
```
```
p + geom_trail(aes(group = age_cut10))

p + geom_trail(aes(group = age_cut10), size = 0) +
    geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_va, 0)), show.legend = FALSE)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
p + geom_trail(aes(group = age_cut10))

p + geom_trail(aes(group = age_cut10), size = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_va, 0)), show.legend = FALSE)
```

## Important information

**I do not assume responsability for your data or analysis**. Please remain always wary when working with data. If you do get results that do not make sense, there may be a chance that the data is in an unfortunate shape for which `eye` is
not suitable. Although I tried to think of many possible ways to have peculiar shapes of data, I am sure there will be far more creative ways out there to abuse data when entering them into spreadsheets.

**eye will work smoother with clean data** (any package will, really!). [Learn about clean data.](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html)

In `eye`, there are not many rules to follow:

**Data coding:**

* Use common codes for eyes ("r", "re", "od", "right" - or numeric coding with 0:1 and 1:2)

**Column names:**

* No spaces! 
* Do not use numeric coding for eyes in column names
* Use common codes for visual acuity ("VA", "BCVA", "Acuity") 
* Use common codes for intraocular pressure ("IOP", "GAT", "NCT", "pressure") 
* Separate eye and VA and IOP codes with underscores ("bcva_l_preop", "VA_r", "left_va", "IOP_re")
* Keep names short
* Don't use underscores when you don't have to. Consider each section divided by an underscore as a relevant characteristic of your variable. E.g., "preop" instead of "pre_op", or "VA" instead of "VA_ETDRS_Letters"
* Use common codes for your patient column (e.g., "pat", "patient" or "ID", ideally both: "patientID" or "patID")
* **Don't be too creative with your names!** 

Good names (`eye` will work nicely)
```{r}
## right and left eyes have common codes
## information on the tested dimension is included ("iop")
## VA and eye strings are separated by underscores
## No unnecessary underscores.
names(messy_df)

names(iop_wide) 
```

OK names (`eye` will work)
```{r}
## Id and Eye are common names, there are no spaces
## VA is separated from the rest with an underscore
## BUT: 
## The names are quite long 
## There is an unnecessary underscore (etdrs are always letters). Better just "VA"
names(amd) 

## All names are commonly used (good!)
## But which dimension of "r"/"l" are we exactly looking at? 
c("id", "r",  "l")
```

Bad names (`eye` will fail)
```{r}
## VA/IOP not separated with underscore
## `eye` won't be able to recognize IOP and VA columns
c("id", "iopr", "iopl", "VAr", "VAl")

## A human may think this is clear
## But `eye` will fail to understand those variable names
c("person", "goldmann", "vision")

## Not even clear to humans
c("var1", "var2", "var3")
```
