## Installation
You can install eye [from CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eye) using `install.packages("eye")` 

Or you can install the development version from github:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjebo/eye")
```
Installing eye will also install [eyedata](https://github.com/tjebo/eyedata/), a package collating open source ophthalmic data sets.

## Details and examples

### Visual acuity
Pesky visual acuity notations are now a matter of the past. Convert between any of Snellen (meter/ feet/ decimal!), logMAR and ETDRS.
The notation will be detected automatically and converted to the desired notation. For some more details see [VA conversion](#va-conversion). For entries with mixed notation, use `va_mixed` instead.

You can also decide to simply "clean" your VA vector with `cleanVA(x)`. This will remove all entries that are certainly no VA.

#### Examples
```{r va}
x <- c(23, 56, 74, 58) ## ETDRS letters
to_logmar(x) # wrapper of va(x, to = "logmar")

## ... or convert to snellen
to_snellen(x) 

## eye knows metric as well 
to_snellen(x, type = "m") 

## And the decimal snellen notation, so much loved in Germany
to_snellen(x, type = "dec") 

## Remove weird entries and implausible entries depending on the VA choice
x <- c("NLP", "0.8", "34", "3/60", "2/200", "20/50", "  ", ".", "-", "NULL")

to_snellen(x)
to_snellen(x, from = "snellendec")
to_snellen(x, from = "etdrs")
to_snellen(x, from = "logmar")

## "plus/minus" entries are converted to the most probable threshold (any spaces allowed) 
x <- c("20/200 - 1", "6/6-2", "20/50 + 3", "6/6-4", "20/33 + 4")
to_logmar(x)

## or evaluating them as logmar values (each optotype equals 0.02 logmar)
to_logmar(x, smallstep = TRUE)

## or you can also decide to completely ignore them (converting them to the nearest snellen value in the VA chart)
to_snellen(x, noplus = TRUE)

# terribly mixed notations
x <- c(NA, "nlp", 1:2, 1.1, -1, "20/40", "4/6", "6/1000", 34)
va_mixed(x, to = "snellen")

# "I only have snellen and snellen decimal notation in my data"
va_mixed(x, to = "snellen", possible = c("snellen", "snellendec"))

# "I have snellen, logmar and etdrs in my data, and there is no etdrs value less than 4"
va_mixed(x, to = "snellen", possible = c("snellen", "logmar", "etdrs"))
```
                            
### Count patients and eyes
Use `eyes` to return a vector, and `eyestr` to return a string for your report. 
```{r eyes}
library(eyedata)
eyes(amd2)

# Same as `eyes`, but as text for reports
eyestr(amd2)

## Numbers smaller than or equal to 12 will be real English
eyestr(head(amd2, 100))

## Or, you can make all numbers english:
eyestr(amd2, english = "all")

## make first number capital letter
eyestr(head(amd2, 100), caps = TRUE)

## you can have all numbers printed as numbers
eyestr(head(amd2, 100), english = "none")
```

### Recoding the eye variable
Makes recoding eye variables very easy. It deals with weird missing entries like `"."` and `""`, or `"N/A"`
```{r}
x <- c("r", "re", "od", "right", "l", "le", "os", "left")
recodeye(x)

## or with "both eyes"
x <- c(x, "both", "ou")
recodeye(x)

## chose the resulting codes
recodeye(x, to = c("od", "os", "ou"))

## Numeric codes 0:1/ 1:2 are recognized 
x <- 1:2
recodeye(x)

## with weird missing values
x <- c(1:2, ".", NA, "", "    ")
recodeye(x)

## Or if you have weird codes for eyes
x <- c("alright", "righton", "lefty","leftover")

recodeye(x, eyecodes = list(r = c("alright","righton"), l = c("lefty","leftover")))
```

### Clean NA entries
```{r}
x <- c("a", "   ", ".", "-", "NULL")
tidyNA(x)

# in addition to the default strings, a new string can be added
tidyNA(x, string = "a")

# or just remove the strings you want
tidyNA(x, string = "a", defaultstrings = FALSE)
```

### reveal
Show common statistics for all numeric columns, for the entire cohort or aggregated by group(s):
```{r stats, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
reveal(iris)

reveal(iris, by = "Species") #can be several groups
```

### getage
- Calculate age in years, as [periods or durations](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/articles/lubridate.html#time-intervals)
```{r age, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dob <- c("1984-10-16", "2000-01-01")

## If no second date given, the age today
getage(dob)
getage(dob, "2000-01-01")                                                    
```


### myop
Often enough, there are right eye / left eye columns for more than one variable, e.g., for both IOP and VA. This may be a necessary data formal for specific questions. However, "eye" is also variable (a dimension of your observation), and it can also be stored in a separate column. The data would be "longer". 

Indeed, R requires exactly this data shape for many tasks: "eye[r/l]" as a separate column, and each eye-related variable (e.g., IOP or VA) in their own dedicated column. 

`myop` provides an easy to use API for an automatic reshape of your data to a "myop" format.

```{r myop, echo=FALSE}
iop_wide <- data.frame(id = letters[1:3], iop_r = 11:13, iop_l = 14:16)
```
```{r myop2}
## Simple data frame with one column for right eye and left eye.
iop_wide

myop(iop_wide)
```
Or another example with many more variables:
<details>
<summary>Click to unfold code to create `wide_df` </summary>
```{r messy df}
wide_df <- data.frame(
  id = letters[1:4], 
  surgery_right = c("TE", "TE", "SLT", "SLT"),
  surgery_left = c("TE", "TE", "TE", "SLT"),
  iop_r_preop = 21:24, iop_r_postop = 11:14,
  iop_l_preop = 31:34, iop_l_postop = 11:14, 
  va_r_preop = 41:44, va_r_postop = 45:48,
  va_l_preop = 41:44, va_l_postop = 45:48
)
```
</details>
```{r eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# library(flextable)
# wide_df %>%
#   flextable() %>% 
#   autofit() %>%
#   save_as_image("messy.png", zoom = 3, expand = 10, webshot = "webshot")
```

<img src="man/figures/messy.png"/>
```{r myop two vars}
myop_df <- myop(wide_df)

myop_df
```

### hyperop 
If you actually need certain eye-related variables spread over two columns, `hyperop()` is your friend:

```{r}
hyperop(myop(iop_wide), iop)

hyperop(myop_df, cols = matches("va|iop"))
```

### blink 
See your data in a blink of an eye - wrapper around [`myop`](#myop), [`eyes`](#eyes), [`va`](#va) and [`reveal`](#reveal). It will look for VA and for IOP columns and provide the summary stats for the entire cohort and for right and left eyes for each variable. 

[**This requires a certain format of your names and codes**](#names-and-codes)

```{r}
blink(wide_df)
```

## Names and codes
**eye works smoother with tidy data** (any package does, really!) 

An important part of tidy data are good names. [Learn more about tidy data.](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html)

### Tips and rules for naming: 
1) Don't be too creative with your names! 
2) Use common coding:
- **eyes**: "r", "re", "od", "right" - or numeric coding r:l = 0:1 or 1:2
- **Visual acuity**: "VA", "BCVA", "Acuity"
- **Intraocular pressure**: "IOP", "GAT", "NCT", "pressure"
- **Patient identifier**: "pat", "patient", "ID" (ideally both: "patientID" or "patID")
3) Column names:
- No spaces! 
- Do not use numeric coding for eyes in column names
- Separate eye and VA and IOP codes with underscores ("bcva_l_preop", "VA_r", "left_va", "IOP_re")
- Keep names short
- Don't use underscores when you don't need to: Consider each section divided by an underscore as a relevant characteristic of your variable. E.g., "preop" instead of "pre_op", or simply "VA" instead of "VA_ETDRS_Letters"

### Name examples
Good names (`eye` will work nicely)
```{r}
## right and left eyes have common codes
## information on the tested dimension is included ("iop")
## VA and eye strings are separated by underscores
## No unnecessary underscores.
names(wide_df)

names(iop_wide) 
```

OK names (`eye` will work)
```{r}
## Id and Eye are common names, there are no spaces
## VA is separated from the rest with an underscore
## BUT: 
## The names are quite long 
## There is an unnecessary underscore (etdrs are always letters). Better just "VA"
c("Id", "Eye", "FollowupDays", "BaselineAge", "Gender", "VA_ETDRS_Letters", 
"InjectionNumber")

## All names are commonly used (good!)
## But which dimension of "r"/"l" are we exactly looking at? 
c("id", "r",  "l")
```

Bad names (`eye` will fail)
```{r}
## VA/IOP not separated with underscore
## `eye` won't be able to recognize IOP and VA columns
c("id", "iopr", "iopl", "VAr", "VAl")

## A human may think this is clear
## But `eye` will fail to understand those variable names
c("person", "goldmann", "vision")

## Not even clear to humans
c("var1", "var2", "var3")
```

### How do I rename columns in R?
When I started with R, I found it challenging to rename columns and I found the following threads on stackoverflow very helpful:

- [Rename single column](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7531868/7941188)
- [Rename columns with named vector](https://stackoverflow.com/q/20987295/7941188)

I find the two following methods straight forward:
```{r}
# I've got a data frame with unfortunate names:
name_mess <- data.frame(name = "a", oculus = "r", eyepressure = 14, vision = 0.2)
names(name_mess)

## rename all names
names(name_mess) <- c("patID", "eye", "IOP", "VA")
names(name_mess)
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
names(name_mess) <- c("name", "oculus", "eyepressure", "vision")
```
```{r}
## To rename only specific columns, even if you are not sure about their exact position:
names(name_mess)[names(name_mess) %in% c("name", "vision")] <- c("patID", "VA")
names(name_mess)
```

## Important notes
**I do not assume responsability for your data or analysis**. Please always keep a critical mind when working with data - if you do get results that seem implausible, there may be a chance that the data is in an unfortunate shape for which `eye` may not be suitable. 

## VA conversion
- VA conversion between Snellen, ETDRS and logMAR is based on charts and formulas in [@holladay], [@beck] and [@gregori]
- Categories **counting fingers** and **hand movements** are converted following [@bach]
- Categories **(no) light perception** are converted following the suggestions by Michael Bach
